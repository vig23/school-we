                <p>Cricket is my favourite sport.I watch cricket and play cricket.My favourite cricket players is Virat
            Kholi and Rohit Sharma.They are quite famous players in addition they are quite often the mvp of
            the match.Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a
            22-yard pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the
            ball bowled at the wicket with the bat, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each batter.
            Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side
            either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat and before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before
            a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams
            swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.</p>

                    LEGO plans to find replacement material for bricks by 2030. In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, LEGO have said they aim to stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other options, which could include hemp. According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work.

                    Deforestation follows a fairly predictable pattern in these images. The first clearings that appear in the forest are in a fishbone pattern, arrayed along the edges of roads. Over time, the fishbones collapse into a mixture of forest remnants, cleared areas, and settlements. This pattern follows one of the most common deforestation trajectories in the Amazon. Legal and illegal roads penetrate a remote part of the forest, and small farmers migrate to the area. They claim land along the road and clear some of it for crops. Within a few years, heavy rains and erosion deplete the soil, and crop yields fall. Farmers then convert the degraded land to cattle pasture, and clear more forest for crops. Eventually the small land holders, having cleared much of their land, sell it or abandon it to large cattle holders, who consolidate the plots into large areas of pasture.

                        The flute is a family of musical instruments in the woodwind group. Unlike woodwind instruments with reeds, a flute is an aerophone or reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening. According to the instrument classification of Hornbostelâ€“Sachs, flutes are categorized as edge-blown aerophones. A musician who plays the flute can be referred to as a flute player, flautist, flutist or, less commonly, fluter or flutenist.<br>
